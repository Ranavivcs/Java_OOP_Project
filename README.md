# 🛍️ Mini Supermarket Java Project

A smaller object-oriented supermarket simulation written in Java.  
Built as part of coursework or practice to demonstrate clean class design, encapsulation, and Java fundamentals.

---

## 🧱 Main Classes

- `Product`: Represents an item for sale
- `Buyer`, `Seller`: Actors in the market
- `Cart`: Holds products for a buyer
- `MarketManager`: Coordinates actions between users and inventory
- `SpecialPackage`: Extends standard products with extra behavior
- `Address`, `User`: Supporting domain classes
- `Main`: Runs the simulation (entry point)

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class relationships and inheritance
- Encapsulation and modular design
- Simple market flow logic (add to cart, buy, manage inventory)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE
2. Run the `Main` class
3. Simulated console output will show market flow (adding items, buying, etc.)
